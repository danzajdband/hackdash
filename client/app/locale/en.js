  "The HackDash was born":"The HackDash was born by accident and by a need. We were looking for a platform to track ideas through hackathons in the line to the <a href=\"http://mediaparty.info/\" data-bypass=\"true\" target=\"__blank\">Hacks/Hackers Media Party</a> organized by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HacksHackersBA\" data-bypass=\"true\" target=\"__blank\">@HacksHackersBA</a> where hackers and journalists share ideas. We spread the need through Twitter and that was the context of the HackDash born. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blejman\" data-bypass=\"true\" target=\"__blank\">@blejman</a> had an idea and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dzajdband\" data-bypass=\"true\" target=\"__blank\">@dzajdband</a> was interested in implement that idea. So we started building the app hoping we can get to the Buenos Aires Media Party with something that doesn't suck. The Media Party Hackathon day came followed by a grateful surprise. Not only the people liked the HackDash implementation but a couple of coders added the improvement of the HackDash as a Hackaton project. After the Media Party we realized that this small app was filling a real need. Three years later, the dashboard is becoming an standard to track innovative ideas around the world.<p><a class=\"up-button\">Create your own dashboard</a>, be part of a global community.</p>",
